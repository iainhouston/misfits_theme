# Drupal 8 Theme for Misfits Theatre Company

### Quick start

-  `npm install`  
    To install all our required `node_modules` including `gulp`

- `npx gulp`  
    -  To invoke local `gulp` without a dependency upon a gloabal `gulp` of, perhaps, another persuasion.  
    -  To set off the gulp toolchain including firing up *Firefox Developer Edition* under `browsersync`  
    -  Ensure you've done `endev` in the project root directory to ensure `browsersync` can operate properly with `link_css`
