 * Default theme implementation to format the simplenews newsletter body.
 *
 * Copy this file in your theme directory to create a custom themed body.
 * Rename it to override it. Available templates:
 *   simplenews-newsletter-body--[newsletter_id].html.twig
 *   simplenews-newsletter-body--[view mode].html.twig
 *   simplenews-newsletter-body--[newsletter_id]--[view mode].html.twig
 * See README.txt for more details.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - build: Render array. Use {{ build }} to print it.
 * - node: object(Drupal\node\Entity\Node)
 *   The node entity with limited access to object properties and methods.
 *   * Methods: Only "getter" methods (method names starting with "get", "has", or "is")
 *     and a few common methods such as "id" and "label" are available.
 *     {{ node.getTitle }} : the Node title ( == {{ title }} )
 *     Calling other methods (such as node.delete) will result in an exception.
 *   * Properties: field values can be accessed as follows:
 *     {{ node.body.value | raw }} : text of body field
 * - newsletter: object(Drupal\simplenews\Entity\Newsletter)
 *     {{ newsletter.from_name }}: string
 *     {{ newsletter.subject }}: string
 * - title: Node title
 * - view_mode: The active display view mode of the node
 * - key: email key [node|test]

 * - simplenews_subscriber: object(Drupal\simplenews\Entity\Subscriber)
 *   The subscriber for which the newsletter is built.
 *     {{ simplenews_subscriber.getMail  }}: string: subscriber's email address
 *   Note that depending on the used caching strategy, the generated body might
 *   be used for multiple subscribers. If you created personalized newsletters
 *   and can't use tokens for that, make sure to disable caching or write a
 *   custom caching strategy implemention.
